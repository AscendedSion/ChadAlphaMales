I'm not gonna bother writing anything here other than these:

```cpp
// I know this might sound dumb but here are the rules before messing with the menu
// Before you add stuff here please tell me first what you're going to add and we'll discuss about it
// Please test stuff before you push, don't pull a fedoraware moment pls :(
// YOU MUST encrypt every string with "_(stuffgoeshere)" except for vectors and shit like that
	// Q: Why can't I do that on vectors?
	// A: Because they fuck up for some reason, idk honestly lol
// Try to fit in as much features as possible without making it look out of place / not user friendly (if that makes sense)
// If you have b1g problems with the menu then message me on discord
```
