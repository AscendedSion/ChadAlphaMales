# ChadAlphaMales (fixed)

The version is 1.6 (2-4 months before the cheat got its last update)

Some stuff like dt and antiwarp are poo

Just don't use this, until the latest version has been "self-leaked"

until then, hf using a broken version of this cheat (might aswell be worse than the leaked version)




# old readme
Feel free to add me on discord zphr#0365 or make a new issue if you have any questions

The source code is utterly shit compared to my new project (private atm, might release it some day to public but not open-source)

The offsets are fucked from the june (?) + january update, feel free to fix it yourself and make a pull request or fork it and continue it by yourself (most likely won't notice it)

Have fun with the semi-old src code (IIRC 1.7 or 1.8 was the latest), the development has been discontinued since february due to lots of funny stuff that happened between me and legacy.
