Feel free to add me on discord zphr#0365 if you have any questions

The source code is utterly shit compared to my current project (not under the name CAM anymore), feel free to laugh at it
The offsets are still fucked, feel free to fix it yourself and make a pull request (most likely won't look at it)
Have fun with the semi-old src code << can't find the latest one atm :), the development has been discontinued (Since february) due to lots of funny stuff that happened between me and legacy.
