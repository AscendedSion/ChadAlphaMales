The offsets are still fucked, feel free to fix it yourself and make a pull request (most likely won't look at it)
Have fun with the semi-old src code << can't find the latest one atm :), the development has been discontinued (Since february) due to lots of funny stuff that happened between me and legacy. 
Feel free to add me on discord zphr#0365 if you have any questions
